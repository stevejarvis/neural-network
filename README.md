Neural Network, Eh
==================

This project was started to learn more about AI and how neural networks operate.

The network here is one consisting of 4 layers (1 input, 2 hidden, 1 out) and
is made flexible with variable numbers of neurons and coefficients affecting
momentum and learning rate. The flexibility makes it easy to see how simple
changes can affect behavior (i.e. epochs until a set is learned, or whether a
set can be learned at all.)
