I've created this project to learn more about AI and how neural networks 
operate.

The network here is one consisting of 3 layers (1 input, 1 hidden, 1 out) and 
is made flexible with variable numbers of neurons and coefficients affecting 
momentum and learning rate. They simple flexibility makes it easy to see how 
changes affect behavoir (i.e. epochs until a set is learned, or whether a set 
can be learned at all.)
